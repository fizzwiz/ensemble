# üé∂ @fizzwiz/ensemble

**A framework for live interactions ‚Äî not just actions.**

`@fizzwiz/ensemble` introduces abstractions that go beyond traditional control flow, enabling you to **orchestrate asynchronous live performances** among event emitters with elegance and clarity.

Currently supported types:

- üé∫ **Player** ‚Äî any event-aware component with a lifecycle (`play()`, `pause()`)
- üé∂ **Ensemble** ‚Äî a live composition of coordinated Players
- üë• **Secondo** - a player re-emitting as events event-like objects as mutations, intersections
- üéπ **Solo** - a player performing some specific behavior through an internal ensemble of cues
