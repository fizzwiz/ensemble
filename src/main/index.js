/**
 * ðŸŽ¼ Core module
 *
 * Provides the foundational abstractions of the `@fizzwiz/ensemble` framework.
 * These classes form the "core" on which other parts of the system perform:
 *
 * - {@link Player} â€” Base performer with a lifecycle (`play()`, `pause()`).
 * - {@link Ensemble} â€” A group of players performing together in coordination.
 * - {@link Solo} â€” Self-contained performer orchestrating internal cues like a miniature ensemble.
 * @module core
 */

/**
 * ðŸŽ¶ Secondos module
 *
 * Adapters that integrate third-party or external event sources into the Ensemble system.
 * They listen to native or custom emitters and re-broadcast their activity as Ensemble events
 * propagated through hierarchies of Ensembles.
 *
 * Variants include:
 * - {@link ObserverSecondo} â€” Base wrapper for observer APIs.
 * - {@link MutationObserverSecondo}
 * - {@link IntersectionObserverSecondo}
 * - {@link ResizeObserverSecondo}
 * - {@link EmitterSecondo} â€” Adapts DOM EventTargets or Node.js EventEmitters.
 * @module secondo
 */

/**
 * ðŸŽµ Player module
 *
 * Specialized Player types that encapsulate different forms of timed or event-driven behaviors:
 *
 * - {@link Secondo} â€” Adapts and echoes events from external sources.
 * - {@link Cue} â€” Reacts to an external event once or repeatedly.
 * - {@link Appointment} â€” A scheduled event that fires at a specific time.
 * - {@link Ostinato} â€” A repeating task with configurable timing and repetitions.
 * @module player
