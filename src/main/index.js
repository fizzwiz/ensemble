/**
 * 
 * ðŸŽ¼ The `core` module defines the foundational abstractions
 * of the `@fizzwiz/ensemble` framework.
 *
 * These classes form the "score" on which other parts of the system perform:
 *
 * - {@link Player} â€” The base performer with a lifecycle (`play()`, `pause()`).
 * - {@link Ensemble} â€” A group of players performing together in coordination.
 * - {@link Event} â€” A rich event object that tracks origin and propagation.
 * - {@link Solo} â€” A self-contained performer orchestrating internal cues like a miniature ensemble.

/**
 * 
 * ðŸŽ¶ Secondos are adapter-players that integrate third-party or external event sources
 * into the Ensemble system. They listen to native or custom emitters and
 * re-broadcast their activity as Ensemble events propagated through hierarchies of Ensembles.
 *
 * Variants include:
 * - {@link ObserverSecondo} â€” Base wrapper for observer APIs.
 * - {@link MutationObserverSecondo}
 * - {@link IntersectionObserverSecondo}
 * - {@link ResizeObserverSecondo}
 * - {@link EmitterSecondo} â€” Adapts DOM EventTargets or Node.js EventEmitters.
